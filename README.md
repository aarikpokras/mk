# mk
The worse alternative to Makefile

## Syntax and Other Stuff
Make a file called `__file` and put a comment in the top line that has a title of your choosing.
```bash
#My Title
```
Please don't put a space between the # and the title.

Your title will show before your __file runs.

All it is is bash. So, if you know bash, you know mk. Just put the stuff you'd normally put in a bash script there. (Other than the `#!/bin/bash`).

When you download it, run `./mk` for more information.

### Make sure to do `chmod` accordingly.
